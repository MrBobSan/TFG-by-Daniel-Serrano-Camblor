## TFG: Analysis of Robot Dynamics Impact on Autonomous Navigation using ROS2

### This is the memory of the Final Degree Project of Daniel Serrano Camblor.

### Anexo I
  
In Annex I there are three folders where you can find the codes that have been used throughout the work to perform the simulations. The three folders are:

	My_package_simulations 
		You will find two folders containing the simulation environment in Gazebo and the .py extension file that executes the launch action with ROS2.
	Navigation2_parámetros 
		You will find the parameters used by the package to load and execute the Navigation2 features for the simulation and the maps that can be loaded. 
		The map used in the simulation is map.yaml, although other maps of our own design can be found in the corresponding folder, which have been used to test the functionality of Navigation2.
	Movement_scripts 
		You will find an automatic movement script in C++, a keyboard-controlled movement script in Python, and a movement script through which we request the robot to move a certain number of meters and rotate on itself.
